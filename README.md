# Real-Time Network Weakness Finder (Backend)This project provides the backend services for a tool that simulates network failures and analyzes resilience. It handles graph processing, attack simulations, and streams results in real-time via WebSockets.## ðŸ§  What It DoesThis backend service is designed to answer a critical question: "If some parts of a network fail, will the rest still work?"It provides endpoints to:Upload a Network: Accept a file representing a connected system (e.g., computer networks, social graphs).Simulate Attacks: Systematically remove nodes using different strategies:Random Failure: Simulates accidental outages.Targeted Attack: Removes the most connected nodes first, simulating a strategic attack.Broadcast Results: Stream real-time metrics over WebSockets as the simulation runs, allowing a client to visualize the network's degradation.## âœ¨ Backend FeaturesFile Upload API: An endpoint to load network structures from simple edge-list text files.Concurrent Simulations: Asynchronous processing to handle attack simulations without blocking API requests.Multiple Attack Strategies: Logic for both random node removal and high-degree targeted attacks.Real-Time Metrics: Calculates the size of the Largest Connected Component (LCC) and the number of disconnected sub-graphs after each removal step.WebSocket Broadcasting: Streams simulation results via STOMP over WebSockets for consumption by any connected client.
